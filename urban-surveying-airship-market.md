<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Urban Surveying Airship Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Blimp</li><li>Semi-rigid</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Urban surveying airships can be categorized into two main types: blimps and semi-rigids. Blimps are non-rigid airships, meaning they have no structural framework and rely solely on the pressure of the gas inside to maintain their shape. Semi-rigids, on the other hand, have a partial structural framework that provides some rigidity to the airship. Both types of airships are used in urban surveying, with blimps being more flexible and easier to maneuver, while semi-rigids offer increased stability and payload capacity.</p></p>
