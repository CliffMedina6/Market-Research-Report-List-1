<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrogen Fuel-Cell Electric Vehicles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles</li><li>Hybrid Electric Vehicles</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydrogen Fuel-Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) and Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) are two types of vehicles that operate on different propulsion technologies. FCEVs utilize fuel cells to convert hydrogen into electricity, which then powers the vehicle's electric motor. This process produces only water vapor as a byproduct, making FCEVs environmentally friendly. On the other hand, HEVs combine an internal combustion engine with an electric motor, allowing the vehicle to switch between the two power sources. HEVs are more fuel-efficient compared to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, emitting lower levels of greenhouse gases.</p></p>
