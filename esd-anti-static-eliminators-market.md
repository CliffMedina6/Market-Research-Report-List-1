<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ESD Anti-Static Eliminators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type Static Eliminators</li><li>Induction Type Static Eliminators</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The ESD Anti-Static Eliminators market consists of two main types: Contact Type Static Eliminators and Induction Type Static Eliminators. Contact Type Static Eliminators operate by physically touching the charged object to neutralize the static electricity. These devices are commonly used in applications where direct contact is feasible. On the other hand, Induction Type Static Eliminators work by generating an oscillating electric field which neutralizes the static charge without requiring physical contact with the charged object. This type of static eliminator is commonly used in applications where physical contact is not possible or practical.</p></p>
