<p><h1>Passive Sonars Market Analysis Examines its Scope on Growth Opportunities, and Forecasted Trends Spanning from 2023 to 2030.</h1></p><p><strong>Passive Sonars Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Passive sonars are a type of sonar system that listens to the underwater soundscape and detects and analyzes the acoustic signals generated by various sources such as submarines, ships, marine mammals, and other underwater objects. Unlike active sonars that emit sound waves and then listen for the echo, passive sonars operate silently by only receiving acoustic signals.</p><p>The passive sonars market is expected to experience significant growth in the coming years. This growth can be attributed to the increasing need for underwater security and surveillance due to rising maritime disputes, piracy activities, and unauthorized underwater intrusions. Furthermore, the growing demand for underwater communication systems, marine research, and environmental monitoring is also expected to drive the market growth.</p><p>Moreover, advancements in signal processing technologies, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques, and the development of autonomous underwater vehicles have improved the efficiency and accuracy of passive sonar systems. These technological advancements are propelling the market growth and opening up new opportunities for market players.</p><p>In terms of regional analysis, North America is anticipated to dominate the passive sonars market due to the presence of key market players, increasing defense expenditure, and technological advancements in the region. Europe is also expected to witness significant growth, driven by the demand for passive sonars in naval applications.</p><p>Overall, the passive sonars market is projected to witness a CAGR of 13.3% during the forecast period. Factors such as increasing maritime security concerns, technological advancements, and the rising demand for underwater monitoring and communication systems are expected to drive this growth.</p></p>
