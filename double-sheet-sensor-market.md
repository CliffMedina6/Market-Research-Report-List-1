<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Double Sheet Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unilateral Contact</li><li>No Contact</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Double Sheet Sensor market comprises two main types: Unilateral Contact and No Contact sensors. Unilateral Contact sensors are designed to detect double sheet issues by coming into direct contact with the sheet. They measure the thickness of the material and provide a signal indicating if it comprises double sheets. On the other hand, No Contact sensors work without physically touching the sheet. They use advanced technologies like infrared or laser to detect any anomalies between the sheets and signal their presence. Both types offer effective solutions for identifying double sheet situations.</p></p>
