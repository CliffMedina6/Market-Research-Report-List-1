<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biomass Black Pellets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Torrefaction</li><li>Steam Explosion (SE)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biomass black pellets are a type of biofuel produced from biomass materials such as wood, crops, or agricultural residues. The market for biomass black pellets can be segmented into two types: torrefaction and steam explosion (SE). Torrefaction involves heating biomass in an oxygen-deficient environment to remove moisture and volatile components, resulting in a dry and energy-dense product. Steam explosion, on the other hand, uses high-pressure steam treatment to break down biomass fibers, making them easier to process. Both torrefaction and steam explosion techniques are used to enhance the efficiency and energy content of biomass pellets for various applications.</p></p>
