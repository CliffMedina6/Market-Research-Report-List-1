<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Unmanned Aircraft Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed Wing</li><li>Rotary Wing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The unmanned aircraft systems market consists of two main types: fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft. Fixed-wing drones are similar to traditional airplanes as they have a fixed wing and require forward motion to generate lift. They are typically used for long-distance missions and offer longer flight times. On the other hand, rotary-wing drones, also known as multirotor drones, have multiple rotors that generate lift and enable vertical take-offs and landings. They are more maneuverable and commonly used for short-distance missions, such as aerial photography and surveillance.</p></p>
