<p><h1>Self-expandable Intracranial Stents Market Size 2023 - 2030 Global Industrial Analysis, Key Geographical Regions, Market Share, Top Key Players, Product Types and Forecast Research Report</h1></p><p><strong>Market Overview and Report Coverage</strong></p>
<p><p>Self-expandable intracranial stents are medical devices used for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms and stenosis of the blood vessels in the brain. These stents are specifically designed to be inserted into the affected blood vessel to improve blood flow and prevent complications such as rupture or stroke. They are made of a mesh-like material that can expand and conform to the shape of the blood vessel when deployed.</p><p>The current outlook of the self-expandable intracranial stents market is promising. The prevalence of cerebrovascular diseases, such as intracranial aneurysms and stenosis, is increasing globally, primarily due to the aging population and the growing prevalence of risk factors like smoking and hypertension. This, in turn, is driving the demand for intracranial stents.</p><p>Technological advancements in stent design and material have improved the effectiveness and safety of these devices, leading to higher adoption rates. The development of newer techniques, such as flow diverters, which are used for treating complex aneurysms, is further boosting market growth.</p><p>Additionally, the rise in minimally invasive neurointerventional procedures is expected to contribute to market expansion. Minimally invasive procedures offer several advantages over traditional open surgery, including shorter hospital stays, quicker recovery times, and reduced risks of complications.</p><p>The future of the self-expandable intracranial stents market looks promising with a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.9% during the forecasted period. Factors such as increasing awareness about the benefits of endovascular treatment options, advancements in stent technology, and the growing geriatric population are expected to drive market growth.</p><p>However, challenges such as the high cost of treatment and the risk of complications associated with stent placement may hinder market growth. Strict regulations and reimbursement policies also pose challenges to market expansion.</p><p>Overall, the self-expandable intracranial stents market is poised for substantial growth in the coming years, driven by the increasing prevalence of cerebrovascular diseases and advancements in treatment options.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-expandable Intracranial Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop Stents</li><li>Closed-Loop Stents</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The self-expandable intracranial stents market includes two types: open loop stents and closed-loop stents. Open loop stents consist of flexible metal wires formed into a spiral shape, allowing them to adapt to the specific vessel wall. They are commonly used to treat wide-necked aneurysms. In contrast, closed-loop stents are designed with a cylindrical structure made of interconnected closed loops. These stents are more stable and often used to treat stenosis or narrowings in blood vessels of the brain. Both stent types aim to provide support and restore blood flow in the brain.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Self-expandable Intracranial Stents Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ischemic Stroke</li><li>Hemorrhagic Stroke</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The self-expandable intracranial stents market application involves the treatment of ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood clot blocks a blood vessel in the brain, leading to restricted blood flow and subsequent brain damage. Self-expandable intracranial stents are used to mechanically remove the clot and restore blood flow. Hemorrhagic stroke, on the other hand, occurs when a blood vessel ruptures in the brain, causing bleeding and potential damage. Self-expandable intracranial stents are employed to stanch the bleeding and reduce further complications.</p></p>
