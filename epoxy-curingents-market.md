<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Epoxy Curingents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Amine-Based Curingents</li><li>Anhydride Curingents</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Epoxy curing agents are used to initiate the curing process in epoxy resins, which leads to the formation of a solid, durable material. There are two main types of epoxy curing agents: amine-based curing agents and anhydride curing agents. Amine-based curing agents react with epoxy resins at room temperature, offering fast and efficient curing. On the other hand, anhydride curing agents require heat to initiate the curing process and typically provide enhanced thermal and chemical resistance. Both types of curing agents are widely used in various industries, including construction, electronics, and automotive.</p></p>
