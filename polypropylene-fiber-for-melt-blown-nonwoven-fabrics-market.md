<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polypropylene Fiber for Melt-Blown Nonwoven Fabrics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>≤35 g/10 min</li><li>> 35 g/10 min</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Polypropylene Fiber for Melt-Blown Nonwoven Fabrics market can be categorized based on their melt flow rates (MFR). MFR is a measure of the polymer's viscosity during the melting process. Types with MFR ≤35 g/10 min have a lower viscosity, resulting in smoother and finer fibers. These fabrics are utilized in applications that require high filtration efficiency, such as medical masks. On the other hand, types with MFR >35 g/10 min have a higher viscosity, resulting in thicker and coarser fibers. These fabrics are commonly used in applications where filtration efficiency is not the primary concern, such as insulation materials.</p></p>
