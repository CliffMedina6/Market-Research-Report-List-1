<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Resistant Flexible Sealant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elastometric Type</li><li>Intumescent Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The fire-resistant flexible sealant market includes two major types: elastomeric and intumescent. Elastomeric sealants are made from elastic materials that maintain their flexibility even at high temperatures, effectively sealing gaps and joints to prevent the spread of fire. On the other hand, intumescent sealants have the ability to expand when exposed to heat, forming a protective barrier that insulates and slows down the fire. Both types of sealants are important in fire safety, offering different properties and applications based on the specific needs of different structures and environments.</p></p>
