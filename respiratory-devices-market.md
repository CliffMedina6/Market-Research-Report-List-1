<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Respiratory Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-invasive</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Respiratory devices market can be segmented into invasive and non-invasive devices. Invasive devices are inserted into the body through surgical procedures, such as endotracheal tubes or tracheostomy tubes, to provide mechanical ventilation directly to the lungs. Non-invasive devices, on the other hand, deliver respiratory support without the need for surgery, utilizing methods like masks, nasal prongs, or helmets. Both types of devices aim to assist patients in breathing and maintaining proper oxygen levels, but invasive devices offer more direct intervention and are typically used for severe respiratory conditions.</p></p>
