<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heat Insulated PVB Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Endothermic Film</li><li>Reflective Film</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Heat Insulated PVB Film market consists of two main types: Endothermic Film and Reflective Film. Endothermic Film is designed to absorb and dissipate heat, providing enhanced insulation by preventing heat transfer. It acts as a barrier, reducing heat buildup and maintaining a comfortable temperature inside. Reflective Film, on the other hand, reflects heat away from the surface, protecting against solar radiation and reducing energy consumption for air conditioning. Both types contribute to improving thermal insulation and energy efficiency in various applications like windows, automotive, and construction.</p></p>
