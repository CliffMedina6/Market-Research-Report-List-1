<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aluminum Gratings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Press-locked Gratings</li><li>Swage-locked Gratings</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The aluminum gratings market can be classified into two types: press-locked gratings and swage-locked gratings. Press-locked gratings are manufactured by pressing and locking crossbars into pre-punched bearing bars, resulting in a sturdy and durable grating structure. On the other hand, swage-locked gratings are constructed by mechanically locking crossbars into bearing bars using a swaging process, providing a strong and rigid grating system. Both types offer excellent strength and load-bearing capabilities, making them ideal for various applications in industries such as construction, transportation, and energy.</p></p>
