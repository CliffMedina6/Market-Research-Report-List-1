<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Slow and Controlled Release Fertilizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Binary Compound Fertilizers</li><li>NPK Compound Fertilizers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Slow-release fertilizer refers to a type of fertilizer that is designed to release nutrients gradually over an extended period of time, thus providing a sustained supply of essential nutrients to plants. Controlled-release fertilizer, on the other hand, is a type of fertilizer that releases nutrients based on environmental conditions, such as temperature and moisture. Binary compound fertilizers are made up of two basic nutrients, while NPK compound fertilizers contain three essential elements - nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Both types of fertilizers are widely used in agriculture to improve crop yield and minimize nutrient runoff.</p></p>
