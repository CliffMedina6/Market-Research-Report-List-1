<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The X-ray FPD Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The X-ray FPD (Flat Panel Detector) market consists of two main types: indirect conversion and direct conversion. In indirect conversion, X-rays are first converted into visible light by a scintillator material, which is then converted into an electrical signal by a photosensitive array. This method is commonly used in amorphous silicon detectors. In direct conversion, X-rays are directly converted into electrical signals using a photoconductive material, such as amorphous selenium. This method offers better image quality and higher efficiency but is more expensive.</p></p>
