<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low Speed Agitator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anchor Impeller</li><li>Helical Impeller</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The low speed agitator market consists of various types, including the anchor impeller and helical impeller. The anchor impeller is shaped like a propeller with several flat blades, which creates gentle, radial flow. It is commonly used for low viscosity liquids and prevents sedimentation. On the other hand, the helical impeller has a twisted design, providing axial flow and higher turbulence. It is suitable for mixing high viscosity fluids and helps in efficient heat transfer. Both types offer different benefits depending on the application requirements in industrial processes.</p></p>
