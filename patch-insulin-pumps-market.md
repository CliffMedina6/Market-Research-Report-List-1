<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Patch Insulin Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed-Loop</li><li>Open-Loop</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Patch insulin pumps are a type of wearable medical device used by people with diabetes to manage their insulin levels. Closed-loop insulin pumps, also known as artificial pancreas systems, automatically regulate insulin delivery based on glucose readings, providing a more precise and convenient solution for patients. In contrast, open-loop pumps require manual input from the user to administer insulin doses, making them less efficient. Both types aim to improve diabetes management, but closed-loop pumps offer a more advanced and automated approach to insulin delivery.</p></p>
