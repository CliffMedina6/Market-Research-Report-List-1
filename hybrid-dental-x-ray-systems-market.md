<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hybrid Dental X-ray Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Digital X-ray systems</li><li>Analog X-ray systems</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Hybrid Dental X-ray Systems market comprises two main types: Digital X-ray systems and Analog X-ray systems. Digital X-ray systems use sensors to capture images of a patient's teeth, which are then displayed on a computer screen for analysis. These systems offer better image quality, lower radiation dosage, and easy storage and retrieval of patient data. On the other hand, Analog X-ray systems use traditional X-ray film to capture images, which must be developed manually. These systems have lower upfront costs but result in lower image quality and require more storage space.</p></p>
