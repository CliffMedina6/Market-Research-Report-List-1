<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Autotransfusion Systems (ATS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Autotransfusion Systems</li><li>Discontinuous Autotransfusion Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Autotransfusion Systems (ATS) are medical devices used to collect and reinfuse a patient's own blood during surgery, reducing the need for donated blood. There are two types of ATS markets: Continuous Autotransfusion Systems and Discontinuous Autotransfusion Systems. Continuous ATS continuously collects, filters, and reinjects blood throughout the surgery, providing a steady supply of blood. Discontinuous ATS collects blood intermittently and requires post-operative processing before reinfusion. Both systems contribute to reduced risk of transfusion-related complications, infections, and cost savings.</p></p>
