<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Auto Exhaust System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Exhaust System</li><li>Dual Exhaust System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The auto exhaust system market consists of two types: single exhaust system and dual exhaust system. A single exhaust system has only one exhaust pipe connected to the engine's manifold, while a dual exhaust system has two separate pipes connected to each manifold. The single exhaust system is typically found in most standard vehicles, while the dual exhaust system is more commonly seen in high-performance or sports cars. The choice between these two types of systems depends on the vehicle's power requirements and the desired aesthetic appeal.</p></p>
