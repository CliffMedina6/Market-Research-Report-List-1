<p><strong>The Internet Protocol Address Management (IPAM) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IPv4</li><li>IPv6</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Internet Protocol Address Management (IPAM) is the process of administering and managing IP addresses in computer networks. There are two market types in IPAM: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 is the traditional and most widely used version, which has a limited number of addresses due to its 32-bit structure. On the other hand, IPv6 is the newer version that uses a 128-bit structure, allowing for a significantly larger number of addresses. The market for IPv4 addresses involves the buying, selling, and leasing of these limited resources, while the market for IPv6 addresses focuses on adoption and implementation of this newer protocol.</p></p>
