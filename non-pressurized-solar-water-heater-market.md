<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-Pressurized Solar Water Heater Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Evacuated Tube</li><li>Flat Plate</li><li>Unglazed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The non-pressurized solar water heater market is categorized into three types: evacuated tube, flat plate, and unglazed. Evacuated tube systems consist of glass tubes that trap sunlight and convert it into heat energy, offering high efficiency and performance. Flat plate systems use a flat collector panel to absorb solar energy and transfer it to water, ensuring better aesthetics. Unglazed systems, on the other hand, are cheaper and less efficient, typically used for heating pools or in warmer climates.</p></p>
