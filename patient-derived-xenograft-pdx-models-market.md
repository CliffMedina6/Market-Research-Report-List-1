<p><p>Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are laboratory animal models used in cancer research, where tumor tissue samples from patients are implanted into immunodeficient mice or other animals. These models mimic human cancer more accurately than traditional cell line models as they preserve the genetic, histological, and molecular characteristics of the original patient tumor.</p><p>The PDX models market is driven by the growing need for personalized medicine and the increasing demand for advanced preclinical cancer models. PDX models hold great potential for developing targeted therapies and predicting patient response to treatment. They enable researchers to study tumor heterogeneity, evaluate drug efficacy and toxicity, and identify biomarkers for patient stratification.</p><p>Market analysis indicates that the global patient-derived xenograft models market was valued at $127 million in 2019 and is expected to reach $248 million by 2027. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.9% during the forecast period. Factors such as advancements in genomics and proteomics, increasing research funding and collaborations, and rising demand for personalized medicine contribute to the market growth.</p><p>Conventional cell line models have limitations in predicting clinical outcomes accurately due to their genetic differences from patient tumors. PDX models address this issue by providing a more clinically relevant platform for drug testing. Furthermore, the development of humanized PDX models, where the animal host is reconstituted with human immune cells, has gained traction in recent years to study the immune-oncology field.</p><p>The PDX models market is highly competitive, with numerous companies and research institutions offering PDX model generation and maintenance services. Key players in the market include The Jackson Laboratory, Crown Bioscience Inc., Oncodesign SA, Champions Oncology Inc., and Charles River Laboratories International Inc. Research institutes, pharmaceutical companies, and biotech startups are actively utilizing PDX models for drug discovery, translational research, and precision oncology. With ongoing advancements in the field of cancer research, the demand for PDX models is expected to grow significantly in the coming years.</p></p>
